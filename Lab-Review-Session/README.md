## 💡 Teaching Tips (For Instructors)

### Successful Review Sessions:

**Do:**

- ✓ Encourage group discussion
- ✓ Walk around and listen to conversations
- ✓ Ask guiding questions instead of giving answers
- ✓ Celebrate correct reasoning, not just correct answers
- ✓ Use culturally relevant examples (Egyptian context)
- ✓ Keep energy high with varied activities

**Don't:**

- ✗ Lecture for extended periods
- ✗ Give answers immediately when students struggle
- ✗ Skip group activities to "save time"
- ✗ Rush through calculations
- ✗ Ignore quiet students

### Managing Groups:

**Group Formation:**

- Random grouping: Count off (1, 2, 3, 4...)
- Strategic: Mix strong and struggling students
- Self-selection: Faster but less diverse

**Group Size:**

- 3-4 students optimal
- Ensure all have roles (calculator, writer, presenter)

### Handling Different Paces:

**If students finish early:**

- Extension questions on worksheet
- Help struggling groups
- Deepen discussion questions

**If students are behind:**

- Reduce discussion time
- Skip optional activities
- Focus on core concepts
